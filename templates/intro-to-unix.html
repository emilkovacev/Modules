# Intro to UNIX

In the previous section, Installing Software, you installed and opened a terminal 
application. In this section, you will learn how to use it!

## A Brief History

Before we get into the details, a brief history lesson! In the 1960s, computers
did not look the way we know now. As opposed to the displays of today, the teletype, 
pictured below, fed in a large scroll of paper which printed computer output.
Other computers had a small, boxy screen, typically called a **terminal**.
Even the simple act of typing was a grueling task, since teletype keys were much 
deeper and much slower.

This meant a few things:

1. Computers could not process graphics, only simple commands

2. Those commands were simple to type, and usually abbreviated

3. Commands were smaller and simpler so that the computer could process them


The advent of UNIX was very much intertwined with the early advent of the internet â€“ 
ARPANET. UNIX was an operating system built in the early 60s by developers at 
AT&T Bell Labs. As opposed to other operating systems, it was designed around
a suite of very small, easily reusable programs. This is the bedrock of what is known
as the "UNIX Philosophy" [1]. You can read a much more comprehensive (and super interesting)
history [here](https://www.britannica.com/technology/computer/Time-sharing-and-minicomputers)!

Needless to say, while UNIX is no longer supported, it branched into two implementations
that **are**: BSD, and more popularly, Linux. If you use MacOS, you are running a version
of BSD called [Darwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_(operating_system)). *Notice, Windows
is **not** UNIX-based*.


## A Short Prefix

Remember how I referenced the **terminal** earlier? The terminal you installed is
(in technicality) a terminal **emulator**, meaning it mimics the behavior of a terminal!
Similar to terminals of old, the only way to interface with the computer is with your 
keyboard, with a set of commands. 

Every terminal uses some language for its commands. Not all computers, including UNIX-based 
computers, use the same language. However, *many* behave the same. The language a terminal
uses is called its **shell**.


## UNIX Filesystem

One thing that UNIX standardized at the time of its creation was a modern filesystem.
Regardless of what system you have now, you should be relatively familiar with how it
is structured. On your computer, you have files, and folders which can store files.
UNIX similarly has files, and directories that store files. From now on, we will use
the term **directory**.

There are a few super important directories that have shortcuts.

* Home: The shortcut for home is `~`. You typically create files and directories here

* Current: The shortcut for the current directory is `.`
* Parent: The shortcut for the parent directory is `..`


## UNIX Commands

UNIX command instructions are formatted like this: `$ command`. 
Note that the `$ ` is NOT included in the command.
Whenever you see documentation about shell commands, they will most often begin with `$ `
to indicate it is a shell command.

Try typing the following command:

```
$ ls
```

What do you notice? The command `ls` is short for **list**, and it lists the contents of your
current directory. `ls` is an example of a command that has a return value, meaning that after
you hit `Enter`, text prints out. My output looks like this:

<code>
    LICENSE			app.py			plugins.py		static<br/>
    README.md		buildme.sh		requirements.txt	templates<br/>
    __pycache__		config.toml		runme.sh<br/>
</code>

This is the directory structure of the Modules project! Notice that each item is
separated by spaces. In this case, templates is a directory, while plugins.py is a file.

Part of the UNIX philosophy, is that **commands do not show anything if they succeed.**
One example is the command `cd`, which is short for **change directory**. Try changing to one
of the directories that `ls` printed earlier. Try the following command

```
$ cd <directory>
```

where `<directory>` is the name of the directory you want to enter! For example, if I want 
to enter templates, I would type `$ cd templates`.



Here is a list of other useful commands:

* `man`: Short for manual, man shows the manual for the command! Try `$ man ls`. 
*To exit a man page, hit `q` on your keyboard*.

* `cat`: Short for concatenate, it concatenates the file and prints it out! 
Try `$ cat filename.txt`.

* `pwd`: Short for "Present Working Directory". It shows you where you are in the filesystem! Try
`$ pwd`.
