# Git

Git is a version control system written by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for the purpose
of maintaining the Linux Kernel. It is available for all operating systems in some 
capacity, and is able to save the state of programming projects over the course of
time, as well as merge the content of two programs. Git is a massive program, and 
has an extensive list of terminology which is important for understanding how to 
use it. This section will provide a list of additional
resources, for your convenience!

## Installing Git

Select the tab with your current operating system, and follow the instructions
to install git:

<div class="tab-group">
    <div class="tab-buttons">
        <div id="linux" class="tab-button">Linux</div>
        <div id="mac" class="tab-button">Mac</div>
        <div id="windows" class="tab-button">Windows</div>
    </div>

    <div class="tab-content">
        <div class="tab" for="linux">
            At the command line, run the appropriate command for your distribution [1]:
            <h4>Debian/Ubuntu</h4>
            <code>$ sudo apt install git</code>

            <h4>Fedora</h4>
            <p><code>$ yum install git</code> for Fedora < 21</p>
            <p><code>$ dnf install git</code> for Fedora >= 22</p>

            <p>
                More distribution commands are available
                <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/linux">here</a>.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="tab" for="mac">
            Open the Terminal app, and run <code>git --version</code>. If you don't
            have git installed, it will prompt you to install it. You can install it
            according to the prompt, or install <a href="brew.org">Homebrew</a> and
            use the command provided underneath [1].

            <h4>Homebrew</h4>
            <p><code>$ brew install homebrew</code></p>
            <p>
                More options are available
                <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/mac">here</a>.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="tab" for="windows">
            Click <a href="https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.39.0.windows.2/Git-2.39.0.2-32-bit.exe">here</a>
            for the latest (2.39.0) 32-bit version of git for Windows [1].
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

## Initializing a Git Project

In this tutorial, we will be assuming you have a complete UNIX setup.

To start, create a new directory and enter it, as follows: 

```
$ mkdir git_project; cd git_project
```

Git initializes an environment in an existing directory. An initialized git directory
is called a **repository**. To initialize your repository, run the following command:

```
$ git init
```

You should see a message that looks like this:

```
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/username/git_project/.git
```

This means that git worked successfully! Git created a directory within `git_project/`
that will store 


## Basics of Git

Remember the module about version control systems? The purpose of Git is to save
the state of our code, and help with collaboration! To save state, there are two
major steps:

1. Staging: Tell git exactly which files you want to save.

2. Committing: Save the state of the files you staged.

### Staging

To stage `filename.txt`, run the following command:

```
$ git add filename.txt
```

You can stage multiple files too, just add spaces in between like so: 

```
$ git add fileA.txt fileB.txt
```

### Committing

Commits come with messages
so that developers can identify which changes were made for what reasons. To commit
your changes, run 

```
$ git commit -m "message"
```

where `message` is a description of the changes you made. **Don't forget to include
the** `-m "message"` **!**

### Other Commands

* `$ git diff`: Shows you the lines you changed since your previous commit.
* `$ git log`: Shows you a log of the commits you made thus far
* `$ git status`: Shows the "status" of your current commit. More specifically,
it shows which files you added in the *staging* process!



*Up to this point, we covered all the essential git commands for using **locally**.
In future modules, we will discuss GitHub, open-source git commands, and more
advanced git techniques.*
